\title{Formalization of a Monitoring Algorithm for\\ Metric First-Order Dynamic Logic}
\author{Thibault Dardinier \and Lukas Heimes \and Martin Raszyk \and Joshua Schneider \and Dmitriy Traytel}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A monitor is a runtime verification tool that solves the following problem: Given a stream
of time-stamped events and a policy formulated in a specification language, decide
whether the policy is satisfied at every point in the stream. We verify the correctness
of an executable monitor for specifications given as formulas in metric first-order
dynamic logic (MFODL), which combines the features of metric first-order temporal logic
(MFOTL)~\cite{BasinKMZ-JACM15} and metric dynamic logic~\cite{BasinKT-RV17}. Thus, MFODL
supports real-time constraints, first-order parameters, and regular expressions.
Additionally, the monitor supports aggregation operations such as count and sum.
This formalization extends previous work on a verified monitor for
MFOTL~\cite{SchneiderBKT2019RV}, which was based on the efficient MonPoly
tool~\cite{monpoly}. Apart from the addition of regular expressions and aggregations, we
implemented multi-way joins~\cite{Dardinier2019AFP} and a specialized sliding window
algorithm to further optimize the monitor.
